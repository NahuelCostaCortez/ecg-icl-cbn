Your task is to classify the following ECG image. Available answers are:

- Normal
- LBBB

Please follow these steps carefully:

---

**Step 1: Recall the diagnostic criteria**

- **Normal ECG:**
  - QRS duration between 80‚Äì100 ms (about 2‚Äì2.5 small squares)
  - Flat or slightly elevated ST segment
  - Positive, low-amplitude, smooth T waves

- **LBBB (Left Bundle Branch Block):**
  - QRS duration >120 ms (more than 3 small squares)
  - Notched or slurred S wave
  - Loss of initial R wave
  - ST segment elevation or discordant T wave

üõë **Important clinical reminder**:
Missing an LBBB can be riskier than overdiagnosing it. If the QRS appears prolonged or there are signs like ST elevation or S wave notching, you are encouraged to favor LBBB ‚Äî even if not all features are fully present.

**Step 2: Contrast Normal vs LBBB ‚Äì before making a decision**

Before analyzing the image, take a moment to mentally compare:

- A **Normal** beat has a short QRS (<120 ms), isoelectric or slightly elevated ST segment, and smooth T wave.
- An **LBBB** beat has a prolonged QRS (>120 ms), notched/slurred S wave, and ST elevation or inversion.

Ask yourself:

- Is the QRS **clearly narrow** or **borderline/prolonged**?
- Are the ST and T waves **normal and smooth**, or **elevated/slurred**?
- Is there any **notching** or **loss of the R wave**?

‚úÖ If there is ambiguity, and the QRS is borderline or ST segment is elevated, favor LBBB for diagnostic safety.

**Step 3: Analyze the patient ECG image**

Now, look carefully at the ECG image provided below. Take a deep breath and pay attention to:

- QRS duration
- ST segment shape and elevation
- Any S wave notching or R wave loss
- General waveform morphology and rhythm

Compare what you observe to the diagnostic criteria and the contrastive reasoning above.

**Step 4: Provide your classification**

Generate your final output in the following JSON format:

{
    "thoughts": explain your reasoning in a clinical and structured way,
    "answer": "Normal" | "LBBB",
    "score": floating point between 0 and 1
}

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not include any extra explanation or markdown formatting. Only return the JSON object as your final response.
