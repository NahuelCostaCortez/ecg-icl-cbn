Your task is to classify the following ECG image. Available answers are:

- Normal
- LBBB

Follow the steps below:

1. To help you find the correct answer, we additionally provide you with example images with their respective labels.

Study the example images carefully, noting the characteristic morphology and timing of each wave type. Pay particular attention to:
1. The shape and duration of each wave
2. The relative position of each wave in the beat
3. The distinguishing features that help identify each wave/complex

Here are the example images:
-----------

2. Take your time and think carefully about patterns that distinguish the Normal and LBBB beats.
	- "Normal": showing typical characteristics including normal QRS duration, isoelectric ST segment, and positive T wave
	- "LBBB": showing features such as prolonged QRS duration, ST segment elevation, and secondary ST-T changes

3. Have a detailed look at the image that is provided below. Take a deep breath and think about what you see in the image. It is significant that you have a focus on every detail. Compare what you see in the patient image to the features you learned about.

4. Generate an output regarding your final thoughts.

Here is the patient image:
