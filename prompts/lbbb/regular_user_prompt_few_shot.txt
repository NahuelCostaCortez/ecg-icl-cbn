Your task is to classify the following ECG image. Available answers are:

- Normal
- LBBB

Please follow these steps carefully:

---

**Step 1: Study the reference examples**

To help you make the correct diagnosis, we provide example ECG images along with their correct labels.

Carefully examine the examples and learn to recognize:

- The shape and duration of each wave (especially QRS)
- The relative position of the waves within each cardiac cycle
- Key differences that help distinguish "Normal" from "LBBB" patterns

Here are the example images:

**Step 2: Recall the diagnostic criteria**

- **Normal ECG:**
  - QRS duration between 80‚Äì100 ms (about 2‚Äì2.5 small squares)
  - Flat or slightly elevated ST segment
  - Positive, low-amplitude, smooth T waves

- **LBBB:**
  - QRS duration >120 ms (more than 3 small squares)
  - Notched or slurred S wave
  - Loss of initial R wave
  - ST segment elevation or discordant T wave

üõë **Important clinical reminder**:
Missing an LBBB can be dangerous. If the QRS is prolonged and there's notching in the S wave or ST elevation, strongly consider LBBB ‚Äî even if not all features are fully present.

**Step 3: Analyze the patient ECG image**

Take your time and look carefully at the ECG provided below.

Focus on:
- QRS duration
- ST segment morphology
- Shape and slope of the S wave
- Any abnormalities or notching patterns

Breathe deeply and consider what you see in relation to the examples above. Be especially cautious not to miss LBBB signs.

**Step 4: Final decision (with safety in mind)**

If you're unsure:
- Re-check QRS duration. If it appears ‚â•120 ms (i.e., ‚â•3 small squares), **favor LBBB**
- If your confidence score is below 0.6 but LBBB features are partially present, re-evaluate and lean toward safety ‚Äî LBBB

Now, generate your output in the following JSON format:

{
    "thoughts": explain your reasoning in a clinical and structured way,
    "answer": "Normal" | "LBBB",
    "score": floating point between 0 and 1
}

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not include any extra explanation or markdown formatting. Only return the JSON object as your final response.
