Your task is to classify the following ECG image as either:

- "Normal"
- "LBBB" (Left Bundle Branch Block)

To do so, you must follow these clinical reasoning steps:

---

**Step 1 – Conceptual grounding (C): Learn the key features of each diagnosis**

To help you form accurate judgments, you are given example ECG images that illustrate the key differences between "Normal" and "LBBB" patterns.

Study them carefully, noting the characteristic morphology and timing of each wave. Pay particular attention to:
  - Is the QRS complex longer than 120 ms? (i.e., more than 3 small squares)
  - Is the QRS complex predominantly negative in lead V1?
  - Is the QRS complex broad and monophasic (entirely positive) in lead V6?
  - Are Q waves absent in the lateral leads (I, aVL, V5, and V6)?

Use these examples to build a strong internal model of how "Normal" and "LBBB" ECGs typically appear.

**Step 2 – Final judgment and confidence (M)**

Use your evaluation to summarize your reasoning professionally, and give a confidence score from **0.0 to 1.0**, indicating how sure you are.

Respond using this exact JSON format **only**:

{
  "answer": {
    "qrs_duration_gt_200ms": true | false,
    "qrs_negative_in_v1": true | false,
    "qrs_positive_monophasic_in_v6s": true | false,
    "no_q_wave_in_lateral_leads": true | false
  },
  "prediction": "Normal" | "LBBB",
  "thoughts": "Summarize your reasoning here, referring to the above features.",
  "score": float between 0.0 and 1.0
}
