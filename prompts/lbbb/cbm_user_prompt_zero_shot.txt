Your task is to evaluate relevant clinical features of the following ECG image. To do so, you must follow these clinical reasoning steps before making a decision:

---

Step 1: Evaluate the following four clinically relevant features **based on the ECG image**:

  - Is the QRS complex longer than 120 ms? (i.e., more than 3 small squares)
  - Is the QRS complex predominantly negative in lead V1?
  - Is the QRS complex broad and monophasic (entirely positive) in lead V6?
  - Are Q waves absent in the lateral leads (I, aVL, V5, and V6)?

Mark each of them as either **true** or **false** based on what you see in the image.

---

Step 2: Summarize your reasoning clearly and professionally, as a medical assistant specialized in ECGs would do.  
Step 3: Provide a confidence score from 0.0 (not sure) to 1.0 (completely sure).
